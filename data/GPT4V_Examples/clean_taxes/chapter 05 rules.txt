17 NCAC 05C .0103	CORPORATIONS OPERATING IN INTERSTATE COMMERCE
The fact that a foreign corporation's activities or operations in North Carolina are a part of its over‑all interstate business does not exempt the corporation from income tax liability. A corporation doing business in North Carolina in any of the capacities outlined in Rule .0102 ("Doing Business" Defined) is subject to income tax even if its only operations in this state are a part of its interstate business. A foreign corporation not domesticated in North Carolina whose only activity in this state is the solicitation of sales of tangible personal property by either resident or nonresident salesmen is not required to file income tax returns.

17 NCAC 05C .0304	ATTRIBUTION OF EXPENSES TO NONTAXABLE INCOME
(a)  Direct Expenses ‑ All expenses directly connected with the production of income which is not subject to tax in this State shall be used to compute the net amount of such untaxed income.
(b)  Interest Expenses ‑ When a corporation earns income which is not taxed by this State (see examples), or holds property that does or will produce untaxed income, and incurs interest expense which is not specifically related to any particular income or property, it shall attribute a portion of the interest expense to such untaxed income and property in determining taxable income reported to this State. The formula used for computing the amount of interest expense to be attributed to untaxed income and property is as follows:
(1)	Value of assets:
(A)	Value of the tax return balance sheet of assets which produce or which would produce untaxed income; *
(B)	Value of all assets on the tax return balance sheet; **
(C)	Determine the ratio or percentage of Subparagraphs (b)(1)(A) to (B) of this Rule.
(2)	Income/Profits:
(A)	Gross untaxed income;
(B)	Total gross profits;
(C)	Determine the ratio or percentage of Subparagraphs (b)(2)(A) to (B) of this Rule.
(3)	Total of the ratios or percentages determined in Subparagraphs (b)(1) and (2) of this Rule;
(4)	Divide the total of Subparagraph (b)(3) of this Rule by two;
(5)	Apply average percentage determined in Subparagraph (b)(4) of this Rule to the total interest expense on the return filed in this state.
(c)  Examples of Untaxed Income are:
(1)	Dividend income classified as nonapportionable (G.S. 105-130.4);
(2)	Dividend income excludable by statute (G.S. 105-130.5);
(3)	Interest income classified as nonapportionable (G.S. 105-130.4);
(4)	Interest income earned on United States obligations and state of North Carolina obligations;
(5)	Other nonapportionable income or exempt income.
(d)  Expenses Connected with Interest Income from United States Obligations ‑ Under G.S. 105‑130.5(b)(1), interest income from obligations of the United States or its possessions is excludable from North Carolina taxable income to the extent such income is included in federal taxable income. Expenses incurred in producing the exempt income must be determined and subtracted from the gross amount earned during a taxable period before the deduction is made in computing the state taxable income. In the computation of expenses related to income from United States obligations, the formula described in Paragraph (b) of this Rule may be used with respect to interest expense.
(e)  Other Expenses Attributed to Nontaxable Income and to Nonapportionable Income and Property ‑ In the determination of expenses other than interest expense attributed to untaxed income, the procedure set forth in the Federal Code for determining expenses related to foreign source income generally referred to as stewardship and supportive expenses may be used to determine the expenses allocated to untaxed income and property producing or which would produce untaxed income. Alternatively, an income formula as outlined in Paragraph (b)(2) of this Rule relating to interest expenses may be used to determine the amount of supportive function expenses attributable to untaxed income. In the determination of "supportive function expenses", direct expenses incurred exclusively in a specific identifiable taxable or nontaxable activity shall be determined and excluded before application of the attribution percentage to expenses. If direct expenses are determinable for a particular activity resulting in an accurate computation of the net income or loss from such activity, the values of this activity shall be removed as elements of the ratio when computing the attribution percentage.

Note: * When the equity method of accounting is used, the increase or decrease in value as a result of such accounting method may be excluded from this value.

Note: ** Equity included in this value may be excluded and the reserve for depreciation reflected on the balance sheet may be restored to the asset value.

The taxpayer shall determine which portion of its entire net income constitutes "apportionable income" and which portion constitutes "nonapportionable income". The various items of nonapportionable income shall be directly allocated to specific jurisdictions pursuant to the provisions of Subsections (d) to (h) of G.S. 105‑130.4. The apportionable income of the taxpayer other than public utilities and excluded corporations shall be divided between the jurisdictions in which the business is conducted pursuant to the property, payroll and sales apportionment factors set forth in Subsections (i) to (l) of G.S. 105-130.4. The sum of the items of nonapportionable income directly allocated to this state, plus the amount of apportionable income attributable to this state by the apportionment formula shall constitute the amount of the taxpayer's entire net income which is subject to tax under the income tax laws of this state.
(b)  The taxpayer shall classify income as apportionable or nonapportionable income on a consistent basis. In the event the taxpayer is not consistent in reporting, it shall disclose in its return to this state the nature and extent of the inconsistency.
(c)  The word "apportionment" refers to the division of net income between jurisdictions by the use of a formula containing apportionment factors, and the word "allocation" refers to the assignment of net income to a particular jurisdiction.

Except for compensation paid to general executive officers and compensation paid in connection with nonapportionable income, for purposes of G.S. 105-130.4, the numerator of the payroll factor is the total amount paid in this State during the tax period by the taxpayer for compensation. In determining the payroll factor, information used to file federal forms 941 and the North Carolina Tax and Wage Reports may be used if the amounts can be reconciled to the amounts used for the payroll factor. If compensation paid to employees is included in the payroll factor by use of the cash method of accounting or if the taxpayer is required to report such compensation under such method for unemployment compensation purposes, it shall be presumed that the total wages reported by the taxpayer to this State for unemployment compensation purposes constitutes compensation paid in this State except for compensation excluded under G.S. 105-130.4(k). The presumption may be overcome by satisfactory evidence that an employee's compensation is not reportable to this State for unemployment compensation purposes.

The amounts paid by the subsidiary or controlled corporation includable in the numerator and the denominator of the payroll factor shall be determined in accordance with G.S. 105-130.4.

SECTION .1000 ‑ SALES FACTOR

17 NCAC 05C .1001	SALES MADE IN GENERAL BUSINESS OPERATIONS
For purposes of G.S. 105-130.4, `sales' by a taxpayer whose business activity consists of manufacturing and selling or purchasing and reselling goods or products includes all gross receipts from the sales of such goods or products (or other property of a kind which would properly be included in the inventory of the taxpayer if on hand at the close of the taxable year) held by the taxpayer primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of its trade or business. Gross receipts for this purpose means gross sales, less returns and allowances, and includes all interest income, service charges, carrying charges or time‑price differential charges incidental to such sales. Federal and state excise taxes (including sales taxes) shall be included as part of such receipts if such taxes are passed on to the buyer or included as part of the selling price of the product.

17 NCAC 05C .1002	SALES INCIDENTAL TO GENERAL BUSINESS OPERATIONS
(a)  The term "sales" also includes gross receipts derived by a taxpayer from business transactions or activities which are incidental to its principal business activity and which are includible in apportionable income. However, substantial amounts of gross receipts arising from an incidental or occasional sale of a fixed asset used in connection with the taxpayer's regular trade or business will be excluded from the sales factor since such sales constitute a "casual sale" of property and the inclusion of such gross receipts will not fairly apportion to this state the income derived by the taxpayer from its business activity in this state. Gross receipts from casual sales are considered substantial if they cause the sales factor to be distorted. For example, gross receipts from the sale of a factory or plant will be excluded from the sales factor.
(b)  In including or excluding gross receipts, the taxpayer shall be consistent in the treatment of such gross receipts in filing returns with this state. In the event the taxpayer is not consistent in its reporting, it shall disclose in its return to this state the nature and extent of the inconsistency.

As applied to a taxpayer engaged in business activity other than the manufacturing and selling or purchasing and reselling of property, "sales" includes the gross receipts as defined in Rule .1001 of this Section (Sales Made In General Business Operations):
(1)	If the business activity consists of providing services; such as the operation of an advertising agency, or the performance of equipment service contracts or research and development contracts, "sales" includes the gross receipts from the performance of such services including fees, commissions, and similar items.
(2)	In the case of cost plus fixed fee contracts, such as the operation of a government‑owned plant for a fee, gross receipts includes the entire reimbursed cost, plus the fee.
(3)	If the business activity is the renting of real or tangible personal property, "sales" includes the gross receipts from the rental, lease, or licensing the use of the property.
(4)	If the business activity is the sale, assignment, or licensing of intangible personal property such as patents and copyrights, "sales" includes the gross receipts therefrom.

(b)  Property shall be deemed to be delivered or shipped to a purchaser within this state if the recipient is located in this state, even though the property is ordered from outside this state.
(c)  Property is delivered or shipped to a purchaser within this state if the shipment terminates in this state, even though the property is subsequently transferred by the purchaser to another state.
(d)  The term "purchaser within this state" shall include the ultimate recipient of the property if the taxpayer in this state, at the designation of the purchaser, delivers to or has the property shipped to the ultimate recipient within this state.
(e)  When property being shipped by a seller from the state of origin to consignee in another state is diverted while enroute to a purchaser in this state the sales are in this state.

(a)  For the purposes of G.S. 105-130.4, gross receipts from the sales of tangible personal property to the United States Government are in this state if the property is shipped to or received or accepted by the United States Government in this state. For the purpose of this Rule, only sales for which the United States Government makes direct payment to the seller pursuant to the terms of its contract constitute sales to the United States Government. Thus, sales by a subcontractor to the prime contractor, the party to the contract with the United States Government, do not constitute sales to the United States Government.
(b)  When the United States Government is the purchaser of property which remains in the possession of the taxpayer in this state for further processing under another contract, or for other reasons, "shipment" is deemed to be made at the time of acceptance by the United States Government.

SECTION .1400 ‑ AMORTIZATION OF BOND PREMIUMS

17 NCAC 05C .1401	PRELIMINARY STATEMENT
If a corporation purchases a bond at more than its face value, the amount of premium paid may be amortized over the life of the bond. However, the allowance of a deduction against net income for amortization of the premium paid depends upon the type of bond purchased by the corporation. For example:
(1)	Amortization of premiums on tax‑exempt bonds by a corporation is mandatory with no deduction allowed in computing state net income.
(2)	A corporation may at its option amortize the amount of premiums paid on taxable bonds over the life of the bonds. If the premium is not amortized by the corporation, it will constitute part of the basis of the bond in determining gain or loss at maturity of sale.
(3)	For state income tax purposes, obligations of the United States or its possessions and obligations of the State of North Carolina or any of its subdivisions are tax‑exempt. Interest income received by a corporation on such obligations is not taxable; however, a corporation must include in its computation of state net income any gain or loss realized on the disposal of such obligations.
(4)	Premiums paid on all bonds acquired prior to January 1, 1963 cannot be amortized but constitute a part of the cost basis of the bonds in determining gain or loss when the bonds are sold.

17 NCAC 05C .1402	TAX‑EXEMPT BONDS
The amount of premium paid upon the purchase of a tax‑exempt bond is amortized over the life of the bond. Amortization for the taxable year is accomplished by reducing the original cost of the bond by a portion of the premium paid, with no deduction against net income for the year. Therefore, when the bond is sold or otherwise disposed of, the basis for determining gain or loss will always be original cost less the amount of premium amortized for book purposes through the year of disposal.

17 NCAC 05C .1403	TAXABLE BONDS
A portion of the premium paid upon the purchase of a taxable bond may be deducted in the taxable year only if an adjustment is made to the basis of the bond. If a taxpayer elects to amortize the premium, the basis for determining gain or loss will always be original cost less the amount of premium amortized and deducted in its tax returns through the year of disposal. Otherwise, the basis of a taxable bond for determining gain or loss will always be the entire amount paid for the bond.

SECTION .0100 - GENERAL PROVISIONS

17 NCAC 05E .0101	REDUCED INSTALLMENT PAYMENTS
The Secretary may reduce the installment payment requirements for the quarterly insurance gross premiums tax and the regulatory surcharge if an insurer submits a written statement to the Department indicating that the insurer reasonably believes that its total estimated payments made for the current year will exceed the anticipated tax liability for the year.
This written statement must contain the basis for the insurer's belief that its installment payments should be reduced and state the factors supporting that belief, such as changes in the law or a reduction in the insurer's writings. The statement must be submitted at least 45 days before the due date of an installment payment. An insurer that files a timely statement may reduce its next installment payment in accordance with the statement unless the insurer receives written notice from the Department that its request has been denied or adjusted.

As used in G.S. 105-130.5A and this Subchapter, the following definitions shall apply:
(1)	"Centralized cash management" means a process by which an affiliated group of businesses makes all or most cash management decisions from one location, such as a headquarters or designated subsidiary, that results in individual affiliates having little autonomy in making decisions concerning how cash is managed.
(2)	"Economic position" means the status of a taxpayer's assets, liabilities, and equity (whether those items are actual, contingent, or potential) and their interrelationship to one another.
(3)	"Material benefit" means an improvement in the economic position of the taxpayer on a pre-tax basis.
(4)	"Material business activity" means an activity that is both:
(a)	An integral part of the unitary group's business; and
(b)	Performed on a regular and continuous basis.
(5)	"Principal member" means a member of the combined group that acts in the group's name in all matters relating to the income tax liability for the combined group, and is the entity responsible for preparing the corporate income tax return and making corporate income tax payments for the combined group.
(6)	"Unitary business" means one or more related business organizations where there is a unity of ownership, operation, and use. It can also exist where there is interdependence in their functions. A determination of whether a corporation is part of a unitary business with another corporation is determined based on the facts and circumstances of each case.

SECTION .0200 – ECONOMIC SUBSTANCE

17 NCAC 05F .0201	ECONOMIC SUBSTANCE TEST BURDEN OF PROOF
The taxpayer has the burden of proving that a transaction meets both prongs of the economic substance test as specified in G.S. 105-130.5A(g).

17 NCAC 05F .0202	REASONABLE BUSINESS PURPOSES
(a)  In proving that a transaction, or series of transactions of which the transaction is a part, has one or more reasonable business purposes other than the creation of State income tax benefits, the taxpayer must show:
(1)	The business purpose asserted was valid and realistic;
(2)	The transaction was a reasonable and realistic means to accomplish the asserted business purpose;
(3)	Evidence exists that shows the taxpayer took steps to achieve the asserted business purpose; and
(4)	The value of the non-State income tax benefits reasonably anticipated by the taxpayer from the transaction exceeds the additional cost associated with the transaction.
(b)  Generally, reasonable business purpose is supported by contemporaneous documentation. Though not conclusive, the absence of contemporaneous documentation weakens the contention that the asserted business purpose is valid.

17 NCAC 05F .0203	ECONOMIC EFFECTS
(a)  In proving that a transaction, or series of transactions of which the transaction is a part, has economic effects beyond the creation of State income tax benefits, the taxpayer must show by objective evidence that a reasonable likelihood of material benefit, other than State income tax benefits, from the transaction existed at the time the transaction was initiated and there was a material benefit to the transaction apart from State income tax benefits.
(b)  In analyzing whether a transaction has an economic effect, the Secretary shall analyze the economic effect on the taxpayer and on the aggregate economic effect on the parties to the transaction.

17 NCAC 05F .0204	ECONOMIC SUBSTANCE DOCTRINE
The Secretary shall rely on general principles of the common law economic substance doctrine as established under federal and state case law in applying each prong of the two pronged test under G.S. 105-130.5A(g), except where case law conflicts with the statute. General principles of the economic substance doctrine include the following:
(1)	Economic substance is a prerequisite to any provision allowing deductions;
(2)	A taxpayer has the burden of proving that a transaction has both purpose and substance;
(3)	A taxpayer has the burden of showing that the form of the transaction accurately reflects its substance and that deductions claimed are permissible;
(4)	The economic substance of a transaction shall be determined based on documentation and data rather than the subjective opinions of the taxpayer; and
(5)	The transactions, not the entities, shall be examined for economic substance.

17 NCAC 05F .0205	ECONOMIC SUBSTANCE FACTORS
Determining whether or not a transaction has economic substance is a fact-intensive inquiry that is dependent upon the facts and circumstances of each transaction made by a taxpayer. The Secretary shall consider or analyze all the facts and circumstances including the following:
(1)	The reasons for the transaction;
(2)	Whether the transaction was a reasonable means to accomplish the asserted purposes;
(3)	Expectations of benefits obtained from the transactions;
(4)	The effects the transaction had on the taxpayer's profits;
(5)	The existence of a reasonable or realistic potential for profit from making the transaction;
(6)	The objective economic impact of the transaction other than State income tax savings;
(7)	The transaction's effect on the taxpayer's State income tax liability;
(8)	The transaction's effect on the taxpayer's tax liability in other states;
(9)	The transaction's effect on the taxpayer's federal tax liability;
(10)	Whether the method of determining the amount of payment is an industry practice;
(11)	The change in the business operations of the parties, if any, after the transaction;
(12)	Whether assets were transferred between or among related parties;
(13)	Whether the business operations related to specific assets changed after any transfer of those assets;
(14)	Whether the entity transferring assets retained control over the assets;
(15)	The tax consequences of the transfer of assets;
(16)	The party or parties who created or developed the ideas which led to the transaction;
(17)	The party or parties who presented the ideas concerning the transaction to the taxpayer;
(18)	Whether the contemporaneous documentation explaining the transaction to the taxpayer discussed profit potential in addition to tax benefits;
(19)	The party or parties that drafted the agreements relating to the transaction;
(20)	The party or parties that negotiated the agreements relating to the transaction;
(21)	The party or parties that dictated the terms of the agreements relating to the transaction;
(22)	Cost-benefit analyses or other studies conducted related to the transaction;
(23)	Non-tax benefits obtained by the taxpayer as a result of the transaction; and

17 NCAC 05F .0206	WHEN STATE INCOME TAX Benefits ARE CONSIDERED
(a)  State income tax benefits resulting from a transaction are considered by the Secretary in determining whether a transaction has reasonable business purposes and economic substance when the State income tax benefits are consistent with legislative intent, such as when the transaction is made in accordance with laws enacted by the General Assembly to encourage engagement in certain types of activities through tax deductions or tax credits.
(b)  When a transaction that generates targeted tax incentives is, in form and substance, consistent with the State income tax benefits designed by the General Assembly, the State income tax benefits shall be considered by the Secretary in determining whether the transaction has reasonable business purposes and economic substance.

17 NCAC 05F .0207	Centralized Cash Management
Although the existence of a centralized cash management system among members of an affiliated group is not conclusive evidence that a transaction lacks economic substance, the Secretary shall analyze the transactions for reasonable business purposes and economic effects. If the cash management transaction, or series of transactions of which the transaction is a part, results in the creation of unreasonably excessive interest expense when compared to industry practice, shifting of assets, or the reclassification of income as nonapportionable or nonallocable, the transaction may be deemed to lack economic substance.

SECTION .0300 – FAIR MARKET VALUE

17 NCAC 05F .0301	DETERMINATION OF FAIR MARKET VALUE
(a)  For purposes of determining whether or not transactions between members of an affiliated group were made at fair market value under the standards contained in the regulations adopted under section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code pursuant to G.S. 105-130.5A(h), the Secretary shall consider all facts and circumstances relative to the transactions, including any transfer pricing studies provided by the taxpayer.
(b)  In determining whether or not transactions were made at fair market value, the Secretary will also apply any federal or state case law developed under section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code and its regulations.
(c)  The fact that a taxpayer has a transfer pricing study will not in and of itself be sufficient to establish that a transaction was made at fair market value.

SECTION .0500 – COMBINED RETURNS

17 NCAC 05F .0501	METHODOLOGY WHEN COMBINed ReTURN REQUIRED OR PERMITTED
When the Secretary requires or allows a corporate taxpayer to submit a combined return, the following methodology applies:
(1)	The starting point is the federal taxable income of the pro forma 1120 for each corporation. The 1120s shall represent federal taxable income "as if" each corporation were not part of a consolidated federal 1120;
(2)	The taxpayer shall combine the pro forma 1120s of the corporations to be included in the combined group; this results in a combination of each corporation's line items in determining combined income.
(3)	The taxpayer shall eliminate the intercompany transactions between members of the combined group in arriving at combined federal taxable income.
(4)	The taxpayer shall make North Carolina modifications (additions and subtractions) as provided in G.S. 105-130.5 to determine combined income subject to apportionment.
(5)	The taxpayer shall include in the apportionment factors the property, payroll, and sales of all corporations included in the combined group as provided in G.S. 105-130.4. All sales into North Carolina by entities within the combined group shall be included in the sales factor numerator. Where an intercompany transaction has occurred and been eliminated in the calculation of combined income, this amount shall also be eliminated from the numerator and denominator of the applicable factor.
(6)	Only one apportionment factor is to be calculated by the taxpayer for the combined group. Unless otherwise provided in this section, the standard three factor formula, which uses the apportionment factors of property, payroll, and sales, shall be used. If more than 50 percent of the group's combined income subject to apportionment is generated from a business activity subject to special apportionment under subsections (m) through (s1) of G.S. 105-130.4, then that apportionment formula shall be used for the entire group. If the taxpayer believes the statutory apportionment method that otherwise applies to the combined group subjects a greater portion of the group's income to tax than is attributable to its business in this State, the taxpayer may propose, and the Secretary shall consider, an alternative method of apportionment. The taxpayer shall apply the combined apportionment factor to the combined apportionable income to determine income apportioned to this State.
(7)	The taxpayer shall add any nonapportionable income allocated to North Carolina to the income apportioned to this State to determine total income subject to North Carolina tax.
(8)	The combined group's income subject to tax may be reduced by net economic losses sustained by a corporation that becomes a member of the group, but not fully used by that corporation prior to becoming a member of the combined group, subject to the provisions of G.S. 105-130.8. Net economic losses brought by a corporation into the group remain with that corporation and, to the extent not used by the group during the years the corporation is part of the group, may be claimed by the corporation in the tax years after the corporation ceases to be a part of the group. The tax years that the corporation is part of the combined group count toward the 15-year carryforward period authorized in G.S. 105-130.8. A net economic loss sustained by the group in a combined return year shall be allocated among the members of the group that reported losses on their pro forma 1120s, after elimination of intercompany transactions between members of the combined group. The amount allocated to each member shall be determined by dividing that member's loss (after elimination of intercompany transactions) by the total losses (after elimination of intercompany transactions) of all members of the combined group in that tax year. To the extent not used by the group during the years the corporation is part of the group, the group's net economic losses allocated to a corporation that is a member of the group may be claimed by the corporation in the tax years after the corporation ceases to be a part of the group. Net economic losses shall be considered used in order beginning with earliest tax year. If more than one corporation brought net economic losses from the same tax year into the combined group and a portion of the losses from that year is used, the amount of used net economic losses shall be prorated among the members bringing losses from that year based on the percentage of each member's losses to the total losses carried forward from that year.
(9)	The combined group's income tax may be reduced by tax credits earned by a member of the combined group, but not fully used by that entity prior to becoming a member of the combined group, subject to the provisions of the specific credits. Because the eligibility for a tax credit is determined at the separate entity level, any unused installment or carryforward of a tax credit earned by a member of the combined group remains with that entity if that entity is no longer a member of the combined group or the group is no longer required to file a combined return. This is applicable whether the credit was earned by the entity before becoming a member of the combined group or while a member of the combined group. For franchise tax purposes, the tax credits may only be used by the entity generating the credit unless the group also files a combined return for franchise tax purposes.

This information shall be included with the combined return in each year the qualifying member becomes eligible to claim a credit or an installment of a credit, even if the group's income tax liability for that tax year is not sufficient for the combined group to benefit from the income tax credit.
(b)  Combined groups eligible to claim income tax credits shall complete Form CD-425, Corporate Tax Credit Summary, on a combined basis and file it with the group's income tax return. If a member of the combined group is eligible to claim an income tax credit limited by statute to 50 percent of tax, the combined group shall also complete Form NC-478, Summary of Tax Credits Limited to 50 Percent of Tax.

Each corporation that is doing business in this State pursuant to G.S. 105-114(b)(3) shall file a separate North Carolina franchise tax return and pay any franchise tax due. Any corporation that is included in a combined income tax return but that is not doing business in this State pursuant to G.S. 105-114(b)(3) is not subject to North Carolina franchise tax.
(b)  The principal member shall file its franchise tax return on the combined group's CD-405.
(c)  All other members' separate returns shall include zero dollars ($0) on the "Net Taxable Income" and "NC Net Income Tax" lines on the CD-405 and include a statement with the return that:

Section .0200 – general principles of application

17 NCAC 05g .0201	assignment of receipts from sales of other than tangible personal property
A taxpayer's assignment of receipts from sales other than of tangible personal property shall comply with the following:
(1)	A taxpayer shall apply the rules set forth in this Subchapter based on objective criteria and shall consider all sources of information reasonably available to the taxpayer at the time of its tax filing including the taxpayer's books and records kept in the regular course of business. A taxpayer shall determine its method of assigning receipts in good faith, and apply it consistently with respect to similar transactions. A taxpayer shall retain contemporaneous records that explain the determination and application of its method of assigning its receipts, including its underlying assumptions, and shall provide those records to the Secretary upon request, as provided in Article 9 of G.S. 105.
(2)	This Subchapter provides assignment rules that apply sequentially in a hierarchy. For each sale to which a hierarchical rule applies, a taxpayer shall make a reasonable effort to apply the primary rule applicable to the sale before seeking to apply the next rule in the hierarchy and shall continue to do so with each succeeding rule in the hierarchy.
(3)	A taxpayer's method of assigning its receipts shall reflect an attempt to obtain the most accurate assignment of receipts consistent with the rules set forth in this Subchapter, rather than an attempt to lower the taxpayer's tax liability.

section .0300 – rules of reasonable approximation

17 NCAC 05g .0301	In general
The rules of this Subchapter set forth the process of reasonable approximation that apply if the state or states of assignment cannot be determined. In some instances, the reasonable approximation shall be made in accordance with specific rules of approximation prescribed in this Subchapter. In other cases, the applicable rules in this Subchapter permit a taxpayer to reasonably approximate the state or states of assignment to obtain a result similar to those made using a specific rule of approximation.

When, by applying the rules set forth in Sections .0900 through .1000 of this Subchapter, a taxpayer can ascertain the state or states of assignment of a substantial portion of its receipts from sales of substantially similar services and the taxpayer reasonably believes that the geographic distribution of the remainder of its sales tracks that of the assigned receipts, the taxpayer shall include the receipts from those sales in its sales factor in the same proportion as its assigned receipts. This Rule applies in the context of licenses and sales of intangible property where the substance of the transaction resembles a sale of goods or services.

In those cases, neither the Secretary nor the taxpayer may modify the taxpayer's methodology as applied for assigning those receipts for the taxable year, through the form of an audit adjustment, amended return, or abatement application. However, the Secretary and the taxpayer may each subsequently correct factual errors or calculation errors with respect to the taxpayer's application of its filing methodology.

(1)	when a taxpayer fails to properly assign receipts from a sale in accordance with the rules set forth in this Subchapter, including the failure to apply a hierarchy of rules consistent with the principles of Rule .0201(2) of this Subchapter, the Secretary shall adjust the assignment of the receipts in accordance with the applicable rules in this Subchapter;
(2)	when a taxpayer uses a method of approximation to assign its receipts and the Secretary determines that the method of approximation employed by the taxpayer is not reasonable, the Secretary shall either substitute a method of approximation that the Secretary determines is appropriate, as provided in Article 9 of G.S. 105, or exclude the receipts from the taxpayer's numerator and denominator;
(3)	when the Secretary determines that a taxpayer's method of approximation has not been applied in a consistent manner with respect to similar transactions or year to year, the Secretary may require that the taxpayer apply its method of approximation in a consistent manner;
(4)	when a taxpayer excludes receipts from the denominator of its sales factor on the basis that the assignment of the receipts cannot be reasonably approximated, the Secretary may determine that the exclusion of those receipts is not appropriate, and may instead substitute a method of approximation that the Secretary determines is appropriate, as provided in Article 9 of G.S. 105;
(5)	when a taxpayer fails to retain contemporaneous records that explain the determination and application of its method of assigning its receipts, including its underlying assumptions, or fails to provide those records to the Secretary upon request, the Secretary shall treat the taxpayer's assignment of receipts as unsubstantiated, and shall adjust the assignment of the receipts in a manner consistent with the applicable rules in this Subchapter; or
(6)	when the Secretary concludes that a customer's billing address was selected by the taxpayer for tax avoidance purposes, the Secretary shall adjust the assignment of receipts from sales to that customer in a manner consistent with the applicable rules in this Subchapter.

(a)  If the service provided by the taxpayer is not an in-person service as defined in Rule .0801 of this Subchapter or a professional service as defined in Rule .1001 of this Subchapter, and the service is delivered to or on behalf of the customer, or delivered electronically through the customer, the receipts from a sale are in North Carolina to the extent that the service is delivered in North Carolina.
(b)  For purposes of this Section, a service:
(1)	"delivered to a customer" is a service where the customer and not a third party is the recipient of the service;
(2)	"delivered on behalf of a customer" is one where a customer contracts for a service but one or more third parties, rather than the customer, is the recipient of the service. This includes fulfillment services, or the direct or indirect delivery of advertising to the customer's intended audience; and
(3)	"delivered electronically through a customer" is a service that is delivered electronically to a customer for purposes of resale and subsequent electronic delivery in substantially identical form to an end user or other third-party recipient.
(c)  A service may be delivered to or on behalf of a customer by physical means or through electronic transmission.

17 NCAC 05g .0902	assignment of receipts from sales of services delivered to the customer or on behalf of the customer, or delivered electronically through the customer
(a)  The assignment of receipts to a state or states when a sale of a service is delivered to the customer or on behalf of the customer, or delivered electronically through the customer, shall depend upon the method of delivery of the service and the nature of the customer. Separate rules of assignment shall apply to services delivered by physical means and services delivered by electronic transmission. For purposes of this Section, a service delivered by an electronic transmission is not a delivery by a physical means.
(b)  If a rule of assignment set forth in this Section depends upon whether the customer is an individual or a business customer, and the taxpayer acting in good faith cannot reasonably determine whether the customer is an individual or a business customer, the taxpayer shall treat the customer as a business customer.

17 NCAC 05g .0903	delivery to or on behalf of a customer by physical means, whether to an individual or business customer
(a)  Services delivered to a customer or on behalf of a customer through a physical means include:
(1)	product delivery services where property is delivered to the customer or to a third party on behalf of the customer;
(2)	delivery of brochures, fliers, or other direct mail services;
(3)	delivery of advertising or advertising-related services to the customer's intended audience in the form of a physical medium; and
(4)	sale of custom software, such as where software is developed for a specific customer in a case where the transaction is properly treated as a service transaction for purposes of corporate taxation where the taxpayer installs the custom software at the customer's site.
(b)  The following rules shall apply whether the taxpayer's customer is an individual customer or a business customer:
(1)	Rule of Determination. In assigning the receipts from a sale of a service delivered to a customer or on behalf of a customer through a physical means, a taxpayer shall determine the state or states where the service is delivered. If the taxpayer is able to determine the state or states where the service is delivered, it shall assign the receipts to that state or states.
(2)	Rule of Reasonable Approximation. If the taxpayer is unable to determine the state or states where the service is delivered, but has sufficient information regarding the place of delivery that the taxpayer may reasonably approximate the state or states where the service is delivered, it shall reasonably approximate the state or states.

17 NCAC 05g .0904	delivery to customer by electronic transmission
(a)  Services delivered by electronic transmission include services that are transmitted through the means of wire, lines, cable, fiber optics, electronic signals, satellite transmission, audio or radio waves, or other similar means, whether or not the service provider owns, leases, or otherwise controls the transmission equipment.
(b)  When a service is delivered by electronic transmission to a customer, the following rules apply:
(1)	Services Delivered By Electronic Transmission to an Individual Customer.
(A)	Rule of Determination. When a service is delivered to an individual customer by electronic transmission, the service is delivered in North Carolina to the extent that the taxpayer's customer received the service in North Carolina. If the taxpayer is able to determine the state or states where the service is received, it shall assign the receipts from that sale to that state or states.
(B)	Rules of Reasonable Approximation. If the taxpayer is unable to determine the state or states where the customer received the service, but has sufficient information regarding the place of receipt to reasonably approximate the state or states where the service is received, it shall reasonably approximate the state or states. If a taxpayer does not have sufficient information to determine or reasonably approximate the state or states where the service is received, it shall reasonably approximate the state or states using the customer's billing address.
(2)	Services Delivered By Electronic Transmission to a Business Customer.
(A)	Rule of Determination. When a service is delivered to a business customer by electronic transmission, the service is delivered in North Carolina to the extent that the taxpayer's customer received the service in North Carolina. If the taxpayer can determine the state or states where the service is received, it shall assign the receipts from that sale to the state or states. For purposes of this Rule, the state or states where the service is received shall reflect the location where the service was directly used by the employees or designees of the customer.
(B)	Rule of Reasonable Approximation. If the taxpayer is unable to determine the state or states where the customer received the service, but has sufficient information regarding the place of receipt to reasonably approximate the state or states where the service is received, it shall reasonably approximate the state or states.
(C)	Secondary Rule of Reasonable Approximation. When a service is delivered to a business customer by electronic transmission where a taxpayer does not have sufficient information to determine or reasonably approximate the state or states where the service is received, the taxpayer shall reasonably approximate the state or states as set forth in this Rule. In these cases, unless the taxpayer uses the safe harbor set forth in Part (D) of this Subparagraph, the taxpayer shall reasonably approximate the state or states where the service is received as follows: first, by assigning the receipts from the sale to the state where the contract of sale is principally managed by the customer; second, if the state where the customer principally manages the contract is not reasonably determinable, by assigning the receipts from the sale to the customer's place of order; and third, if the customer's place of order is not reasonably determinable, by assigning the receipts from the sale using the customer's billing address. However, if the taxpayer derives more than five percent of its receipts from sales of services from any single customer, the taxpayer shall identify the state where the contract of sale is principally managed by that customer.
(D)	Safe Harbor. When a service is delivered to a business customer by electronic transmission, a taxpayer may not be able to determine, or reasonably approximate under Part (B) of this Subparagraph, the state or states where the service is received. In these cases, the taxpayer may, in lieu of the rule stated in Part (C) of this Subparagraph, apply the safe harbor stated in this Sub-Item. Under this safe harbor, a taxpayer may assign its receipts from sales to a particular customer based upon the customer's billing address in a taxable year where the taxpayer engages in substantially similar service transactions with more than 250 customers, whether business or individual, and does not derive more than five percent of its receipts from sales of all services from that customer.
(E)	Related Entity Transactions. When a service is delivered by electronic transmission to a business customer that is a related entity, the taxpayer may not use the secondary rule of reasonable approximation in Part (C) of this Subparagraph but may use the rule of reasonable approximation in Part (B) of this Subparagraph, and the safe harbor in Part (D) of this Subparagraph. The Secretary may aggregate sales to related entities in determining whether the sales exceed five percent of receipts from sales of all services under that safe harbor provision.

17 NCAC 05g .0905	services delivered electronically through or on behalf of an individual or business customer
When a service is delivered electronically "on behalf of" or "through" a customer as defined in Rule .0901 of this Subchapter, the methodology provided under this Rule applies.
(1)	Rule of Determination. In the case of the delivery of a service by electronic transmission, where the service is delivered electronically to end users or other third-party recipients through or on behalf of the customer, the service is delivered in North Carolina to the extent that the end users or other third-party recipients are in North Carolina. For example, in the case of the direct or indirect delivery of advertising on behalf of a customer to the customer's intended audience by electronic means, the service is delivered in North Carolina to the extent that the audience for the advertising is in North Carolina. In the case of the delivery of a service to a customer that acts as an intermediary in reselling the service in substantially identical form to third-party recipients, the service is delivered in North Carolina to the extent that the end users or other third-party recipients receive the services in North Carolina. The provisions in this Sub-Item apply whether the taxpayer's customer is an individual customer or a business customer and whether the end users or other third-party recipients to which the services are delivered through or on behalf of the customer are individuals or businesses.
(2)	Rule of Reasonable Approximation. If the taxpayer cannot determine the state or states where the services are actually delivered to the end users or other third-party recipients either through or on behalf of the customer, but has sufficient information regarding the place of delivery that the taxpayer may reasonably approximate the state or states where the services are delivered, it shall reasonably do so.
(3)	Select Secondary Rules of Reasonable Approximation.
(a)	If a taxpayer's service is the direct or indirect electronic delivery of advertising on behalf of its customer to the customer's intended audience, and if the taxpayer lacks sufficient information regarding the location of the audience that the taxpayer may determine or reasonably approximate that location, the taxpayer shall reasonably approximate the audience in a state for the advertising using the following secondary rules of reasonable approximation. If a taxpayer is delivering advertising directly or indirectly to a known list of subscribers, the taxpayer shall reasonably approximate the audience for advertising in a state using a percentage that reflects the ratio of the state's subscribers in the specific geographic area where the advertising is delivered relative to the total subscribers in that area. For a taxpayer with less information about its audience, the taxpayer shall reasonably approximate the audience in a state using the percentage that reflects the ratio of the state's population in the specific geographic area where the advertising is delivered relative to the total population in that area.
(b)	If a taxpayer's service is the delivery of a service to a customer that then acts as the taxpayer's intermediary in reselling that service to end users or other third party recipients, and the taxpayer lacks sufficient information regarding the location of the end users or other third party recipients that the taxpayer may determine or reasonably approximate that location, the taxpayer shall reasonably approximate the extent to which the service is received in a state by using the percentage that reflects the ratio of the state's population in the specific geographic area where the taxpayer's intermediary resells the services, relative to the total population in that area.
(c)	When using the secondary reasonable approximation methods provided in Sub-items (3)(a) or (b), the relevant specific geographic area of delivery includes only the areas where the service was substantially and materially delivered or resold. Unless the taxpayer demonstrates the contrary, it shall be presumed that the area where the service was substantially and materially delivered or resold does not include areas outside the United States.

17 NCAC 05g .1002	Overlap with Other Categories of Services
(a)  Certain services that fall within the definition of "professional services" set forth in this Section shall be treated as "in-person services" within the meaning of Section .0800 of this Subchapter, and shall be assigned under the rules of that Section. Specifically, professional services that are physically provided in person by the taxpayer such as carpentry, certain medical and dental services, or child care services when the customer or the customer's real or tangible property upon which the services are provided is in the same location as the service provider at the time the services are performed are "in-person services" and shall be assigned as such, notwithstanding that they may also be considered to be "professional services."
(b)  Professional services where the service is of an intellectual or intangible nature, such as legal, accounting, financial, and consulting services, shall be assigned as professional services under the rules of this Section, notwithstanding the fact that these services may involve some amount of in-person contact.
(c)  Professional services may include the transmission of documents or other communications by mail or by electronic means. In these cases, the assignment rules that apply are those set forth in this Section, and not those set forth in Section .0900 of this Subchapter, pertaining to services delivered to a customer or through or on behalf of a customer.

17 NCAC 05G .1003	Assignment of Receipts
The location of delivery of professional services shall not be determined by a general rule of determination, but shall be reasonably approximated. The assignment of receipts from a sale of a professional service depends on whether the customer is an individual or a business customer. When the taxpayer, acting in good faith, cannot reasonably determine whether the customer is an individual or a business customer, the taxpayer shall treat the customer as a business customer. For purposes of assigning the receipts from a sale of a professional service, a taxpayer's customer is the person that contracts for the service, irrespective of whether another person pays for or also benefits from the taxpayer's services.

17 NCAC 05g .1004	professional services other than architectural or engineering services
Receipts from sales of professional services other than those services described in Rules .1005 - .1006 of this Section, shall be assigned as follows:
(1)	Professional Services Delivered to Individual Customers. Except as otherwise provided in Section .1000 of this Subchapter, in any instance where the service provided is a professional service and the taxpayer's customer is an individual customer, the state or states where the service is delivered shall be reasonably approximated as set forth in this Rule. The taxpayer shall assign the receipts from a sale to the customer's state of primary residence, or, if the taxpayer cannot reasonably identify the customer's state of primary residence, to the state of the customer's billing address. However, when the taxpayer derives more than five percent of its receipts from sales of all services from an individual customer, the taxpayer shall identify the customer's state of primary residence and assign the receipts from the service or services provided to that customer to that state.
(2)	Professional Services Delivered to Business Customers. When the taxpayer provides a professional service to a business customer, the state or states where the service is delivered shall be reasonably approximated as set forth in this Rule. Unless the taxpayer uses the safe harbor set forth in Item (3) of this Rule, the taxpayer shall assign the receipts from the sale as follows:
(a)	by assigning the receipts to the state where the contract of sale is principally managed by the customer;
(b)	if the place of customer management is not reasonably determinable, to the customer's place of order; and
(c)	if the customer place of order is not reasonably determinable, to the customer's billing address.
When the taxpayer derives more than five percent of its receipts from sales of all services from a customer, the taxpayer is required to identify the state where the contract of sale is principally managed by the customer.
(3)	Safe Harbor; Large Volume of Transactions. Notwithstanding the rules set forth in Items (1) and (2) of this Rule, a taxpayer may assign its receipts from sales to a particular customer based on the customer's billing address in any taxable year when the taxpayer engages in substantially similar service transactions with more than 250 customers, whether individual or business, and does not derive more than five percent of its receipts from sales of all services from that customer.

17 NCAC 05g .1005	architectural or engineering services with respect to Real or Tangible Personal Property
(a)  Architectural and engineering services with respect to real or tangible personal property shall be professional services within the meaning of this Section. The receipts from a sale of an architectural service shall be assigned to a state or states to the extent that the services are with respect to real estate improvements located, or expected to be located, in the state or states. The receipts from a sale of an engineering service shall be assigned to a state or states to the extent that the services are with respect to tangible or real property located in the state or states, including real estate improvements located in, or expected to be located in, the state or states.
(b)  This Rule shall apply whether or not the customer is an individual or business customer. In any instance in which architectural or engineering services are not described in this Rule, the receipts from a sale of these services shall be assigned under Rule .1004 of this Section.

17 NCAC 05G .1006	Related entity transactions
When the professional service is sold to a related entity, rather than applying the rule for professional services delivered to business customers in Rule .1004(2) of this Section, the state or states where the service is assigned is the place of receipt by the related entity as reasonably approximated using the following hierarchy:
(1)	if the service primarily relates to specific operations or activities of a related entity conducted in one or more locations, then to the state or states where those operations or activities are conducted in proportion to the related entity's payroll at the locations to which the service relates in the state or states; or
(2)	if the service does not primarily relate to specific operations or activities of a related entity conducted in particular locations, but instead relates to the operations of the related entity generally, then to the state or states where the related entity has employees, in proportion to the related entity's payroll in those states. The taxpayer may use the safe harbor provided by Rule .1004(3) of this Section.

section .1100 – license or lease of intangible property

17 NCAC 05g .1101	In General
(a)  The receipts from the license of intangible property shall be assigned to North Carolina to the extent the intangible is used in North Carolina. The term "use" shall refer to the location of the taxpayer's market for the use of the intangible property that is being licensed and shall not refer to the location of the property or payroll of the taxpayer. This Section sets forth the rules to determine the location of the use of intangible property for several specific types of licensing transactions.
(b)  A license of intangible property that conveys all substantial rights in that property shall be treated as a sale of intangible property for purposes of these rules. For purposes of Sections .1100 and .1200, a sale or exchange of intangible property shall be treated as a license of that property where the receipts from the sale or exchange derive from payments that are contingent on the productivity, use, or disposition of the property.
(c)  Intangible property licensed as part of the sale or lease of tangible property shall be treated under these rules as the sale or lease of tangible property.
(d)  Nothing in this Section shall be construed to allow or require inclusion of sales in the sales factor that are not included in the definition of "sales" pursuant to G.S. 105-130.4, or that are excluded from the numerator and the denominator of the sales factor pursuant to G.S. 105-130.4(l)(6). To the extent that the transfer of either a security or business "goodwill" or similar intangible value, including "going concern value" or "workforce in place," is characterized as a license or lease of intangible property, receipts from such transaction shall be excluded from the numerator and the denominator of the taxpayer's sales factor.

17 NCAC 05G .1102	License of a Marketing intangible
(a)  If a license is granted for the right to use intangible property in connection with the sale, lease, license, or other marketing of goods, services, or other items, such as a marketing intangible, to a consumer, the royalties or other licensing fees paid by the licensee for that marketing intangible shall be assigned to North Carolina to the extent that those fees are attributable to the sale or other provision of goods, services, or other items purchased or otherwise acquired by consumers in North Carolina.
(b)  License of a marketing intangible includes the following when it is intended to promote consumer sales:
(1)	the license of a service mark, trademark, or trade name;
(2)	copyrights;
(3)	the license of a film, television or multimedia production or event for commercial distribution; and
(4)	a franchise agreement.
(c)  In the case of the license of a marketing intangible, where a taxpayer has actual evidence of the amount or proportion of its receipts that is attributable to North Carolina, it shall assign that amount or proportion to North Carolina. In the absence of actual evidence of the amount or proportion of the licensee's receipts that are derived from North Carolina consumers, the portion of the licensing fee to be assigned to North Carolina shall be reasonably approximated by multiplying the total fee by a percentage that reflects the ratio of the North Carolina population in the specific geographic area where the licensee makes material use of the intangible property to regularly market its goods, services, or other items relative to the total population in that area.
(d)  If the license of a marketing intangible is for the right to use the intangible property in connection with sales or other transfers at wholesale rather than directly to retail customers, the portion of the licensing fee to be assigned to North Carolina shall be reasonably approximated by multiplying the total fee by a percentage that reflects the ratio of the North Carolina population in the specific geographic area where the licensee's goods, services, or other items are ultimately and materially marketed using the intangible property relative to the total population of that area. Unless the taxpayer demonstrates that the marketing intangible is materially used in the marketing of items outside the United States, the fees from licensing that marketing intangible shall be presumed to be derived from within the United States.

(a)  Where a license is granted for the right to use intangible property, other than in connection with the sale, lease, license, or other marketing of goods, services, or other items, and the license will be used in a production capacity (a "production intangible"), the licensing fees paid by the licensee for that right shall be assigned to North Carolina to the extent that the use for which the fees are paid takes place in North Carolina.
(b)  License of a production intangible includes the license of a patent, a copyright, or trade secrets to be used in a manufacturing process, where the value of the intangible lies predominately in its use in that process.
(c)  Where the actual use of intangible property pursuant to a license of a production intangible takes place in part in North Carolina, the entire use shall be in this State except to the extent that the taxpayer is able to demonstrate that the actual location of a portion of the use takes place outside North Carolina.
(d)  When a license of a production intangible to a related entity, the taxpayer shall assign the receipts to where the intangible property is actually used. When a license of a production intangible to a party other than a related entity where the location of actual use is unknown, the use of the intangible property takes place in the state of the licensee's commercial domicile when a business, or the licensee's state of primary residence when an individual.

Where a license of intangible property includes both a license of a marketing intangible and a license of a production intangible (a "mixed intangible") and the fees to be paid in each instance are separately and reasonably stated in the licensing contract, the Secretary shall accept that separate statement for purposes of these Rules. If a license of intangible property includes both a license of a marketing intangible and a license of a production intangible and the fees to be paid in each instance are not separately and reasonably stated in the contract, the licensing fees were paid entirely for the license of the marketing intangible, except to the extent that the taxpayer can reasonably establish otherwise.

17 NCAC 05g .1105	License of Intangible property when substance of the transaction resembles a sale of goods or services
(a)  When the license of intangible property resembles the sale of an electronically-delivered good or service, rather than the license of a marketing intangible or production intangible, the receipts shall be assigned by applying Rules .0904 and .0905 of this Subchapter. Transactions to be assigned under this Rule include the license of:
(1)	database access;
(2)	access to information;
(3)	digital goods; and
(4)	certain software, where the transaction is not the license of pre-written software treated as the sale of tangible personal property.
(b)  Sublicenses. The provisions of Rule .0905 of this Subchapter shall apply where a taxpayer licenses intangible property to a customer that in turn sublicenses the intangible property to end users as if the transaction were a service delivered electronically through a customer to end users. Rule .0905 of this Subchapter shall apply to services delivered electronically to a customer for purposes of resale and subsequent electronic delivery in substantially identical form to end users or other recipients shall also apply with respect to licenses of intangible property for purposes of sublicense to end users. For this purpose, the intangible property sublicensed to an end user shall not fail to be substantially identical to the property that was licensed to the sublicensor where the sublicense transfers a reduced bundle of rights with respect to that property, such as when the sublicensee's rights are limited to its own use of the property and do not include the ability to grant a further sublicense, or because that property is bundled with additional services or items of property.

section .1200 – sale of intangible property

17 NCAC 05g .1201	assignment of receipts
The assignment of receipts to a state or states in the instance of a sale or exchange of intangible property depends upon the nature of the intangible property sold. For purposes of this Section, a sale or exchange of intangible property includes a license of that property where the transaction is treated for tax purposes as a sale of all substantial rights in the property and the receipts from the transaction are not contingent on the productivity, use, or disposition of the property.
(1)	In the case of a sale or exchange of intangible property where the property sold or exchanged is a contract right, government license, or similar intangible property that authorizes the holder to conduct a business activity in a specific geographic area, the receipts from the sale shall be assigned to a state to the extent that the intangible property is used or is authorized to be used within the state. If the intangible property is used or may be used only in this State, the taxpayer shall assign the receipts from the sale to North Carolina. If the intangible property is used or is authorized to be used in North Carolina and one or more other states, the taxpayer shall assign the receipts from the sale to North Carolina to the extent that the intangible property is used in or authorized for use in North Carolina, through the means of a reasonable approximation.
(2)	In the case of a sale or exchange of intangible property where the receipts from the sale or exchange are contingent on the productivity, use, or disposition of the property, the receipts from the sale shall be assigned by applying the rules set forth in Section .1100 of this Subchapter.
(3)	In the case of a sale or exchange of intangible property where the substance of the transaction resembles a sale of goods or services and where the receipts from the sale or exchange do not derive from payments contingent on the productivity, use, or disposition of the property, the receipts from the sale shall be assigned by applying the rules set forth in Rule .1105 of this Subchapter.
(4)	Receipts from the sale of intangible property shall not be included in the sales factor in any case when the sale does not give rise to receipts within the meaning of Rule .0401 of this Subchapter. In addition, in any case where the sale of intangible property results in receipts within the meaning of Section .0400 of this Subchapter, those receipts shall be excluded from the numerator and the denominator of the taxpayer's sales factor if the receipts are not referenced in G.S. 105.130.4(l). The sale of intangible property that is excluded from the numerator and denominator of the taxpayer's sales factor under this provision includes the sale of business "goodwill," the sale of an agreement not to compete, or similar intangible value.

section .1300 – special rules

17 NCAC 05g .1301	software transactions
