17 NCAC 05C .0304	ATTRIBUTION OF EXPENSES TO NONTAXABLE INCOME
(a)  Direct Expenses ‑ All expenses directly connected with the production of income which is not subject to tax in this State shall be used to compute the net amount of such untaxed income.
(b)  Interest Expenses ‑ When a corporation earns income which is not taxed by this State (see examples), or holds property that does or will produce untaxed income, and incurs interest expense which is not specifically related to any particular income or property, it shall attribute a portion of the interest expense to such untaxed income and property in determining taxable income reported to this State. The formula used for computing the amount of interest expense to be attributed to untaxed income and property is as follows:
(1)	Value of assets:
(A)	Value of the tax return balance sheet of assets which produce or which would produce untaxed income; *
(B)	Value of all assets on the tax return balance sheet; **
(C)	Determine the ratio or percentage of Subparagraphs (b)(1)(A) to (B) of this Rule.
(2)	Income/Profits:
(A)	Gross untaxed income;
(B)	Total gross profits;
(C)	Determine the ratio or percentage of Subparagraphs (b)(2)(A) to (B) of this Rule.
(3)	Total of the ratios or percentages determined in Subparagraphs (b)(1) and (2) of this Rule;
(4)	Divide the total of Subparagraph (b)(3) of this Rule by two;
(5)	Apply average percentage determined in Subparagraph (b)(4) of this Rule to the total interest expense on the return filed in this state.
(c)  Examples of Untaxed Income are:
(1)	Dividend income classified as nonapportionable (G.S. 105-130.4);
(2)	Dividend income excludable by statute (G.S. 105-130.5);
(3)	Interest income classified as nonapportionable (G.S. 105-130.4);
(4)	Interest income earned on United States obligations and state of North Carolina obligations;
(5)	Other nonapportionable income or exempt income.
(d)  Expenses Connected with Interest Income from United States Obligations ‑ Under G.S. 105‑130.5(b)(1), interest income from obligations of the United States or its possessions is excludable from North Carolina taxable income to the extent such income is included in federal taxable income. Expenses incurred in producing the exempt income must be determined and subtracted from the gross amount earned during a taxable period before the deduction is made in computing the state taxable income. In the computation of expenses related to income from United States obligations, the formula described in Paragraph (b) of this Rule may be used with respect to interest expense.
(e)  Other Expenses Attributed to Nontaxable Income and to Nonapportionable Income and Property ‑ In the determination of expenses other than interest expense attributed to untaxed income, the procedure set forth in the Federal Code for determining expenses related to foreign source income generally referred to as stewardship and supportive expenses may be used to determine the expenses allocated to untaxed income and property producing or which would produce untaxed income. Alternatively, an income formula as outlined in Paragraph (b)(2) of this Rule relating to interest expenses may be used to determine the amount of supportive function expenses attributable to untaxed income. In the determination of "supportive function expenses", direct expenses incurred exclusively in a specific identifiable taxable or nontaxable activity shall be determined and excluded before application of the attribution percentage to expenses. If direct expenses are determinable for a particular activity resulting in an accurate computation of the net income or loss from such activity, the values of this activity shall be removed as elements of the ratio when computing the attribution percentage.

Note: * When the equity method of accounting is used, the increase or decrease in value as a result of such accounting method may be excluded from this value.

Note: ** Equity included in this value may be excluded and the reserve for depreciation reflected on the balance sheet may be restored to the asset value.

(b)  The taxpayer shall be consistent in the treatment of compensation paid in filing returns with this state. In the event the taxpayer is not consistent in its reporting it shall disclose in its return to this state the nature and extent of the inconsistency.

Payments made to an independent contractor or any other person not classifiable as an employee are excluded from the term "compensation" for purposes of G.S. 105-130.4. Only amounts paid directly to employees are included in the payroll factor. Amounts considered paid directly include the value of board, rent, housing, lodging and other benefits or services furnished to employees by the taxpayer in return for personal services provided that such amounts constitute income to the recipient under the Federal Internal Revenue Code. In the case of employees not subject to the Federal Internal Revenue Code, e.g., those employed in foreign countries, the determination of whether such benefits or services constitute income to the employees shall be made as though such employees were subject to the Federal Internal Revenue Code.

Except for compensation paid to general executive officers and compensation paid in connection with nonapportionable income the denominator of the payroll factor is the total compensation paid everywhere during the income year. Accordingly, compensation paid to employees whose services are performed entirely in a state where the taxpayer is exempt from taxation, for example, by Public Law 86‑272, is included in the denominator of the payroll factor.
Note: A taxpayer has employees in its state of legal domicile (State A) and is taxable in State B. In addition the taxpayer has other employees whose services are performed entirely in State C where the taxpayer is exempt from taxation by Public Law 86‑272. As to these latter employees, the compensation will be assigned to State C where their services are performed (i.e. included in the denominator only of the payroll factor) even though the taxpayer is not taxable in State C.

Except for compensation paid to general executive officers and compensation paid in connection with nonapportionable income, for purposes of G.S. 105-130.4, the numerator of the payroll factor is the total amount paid in this State during the tax period by the taxpayer for compensation. In determining the payroll factor, information used to file federal forms 941 and the North Carolina Tax and Wage Reports may be used if the amounts can be reconciled to the amounts used for the payroll factor. If compensation paid to employees is included in the payroll factor by use of the cash method of accounting or if the taxpayer is required to report such compensation under such method for unemployment compensation purposes, it shall be presumed that the total wages reported by the taxpayer to this State for unemployment compensation purposes constitutes compensation paid in this State except for compensation excluded under G.S. 105-130.4(k). The presumption may be overcome by satisfactory evidence that an employee's compensation is not reportable to this State for unemployment compensation purposes.

SECTION .1000 ‑ SALES FACTOR

17 NCAC 05C .1001	SALES MADE IN GENERAL BUSINESS OPERATIONS
For purposes of G.S. 105-130.4, `sales' by a taxpayer whose business activity consists of manufacturing and selling or purchasing and reselling goods or products includes all gross receipts from the sales of such goods or products (or other property of a kind which would properly be included in the inventory of the taxpayer if on hand at the close of the taxable year) held by the taxpayer primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of its trade or business. Gross receipts for this purpose means gross sales, less returns and allowances, and includes all interest income, service charges, carrying charges or time‑price differential charges incidental to such sales. Federal and state excise taxes (including sales taxes) shall be included as part of such receipts if such taxes are passed on to the buyer or included as part of the selling price of the product.

17 NCAC 05C .1002	SALES INCIDENTAL TO GENERAL BUSINESS OPERATIONS
(a)  The term "sales" also includes gross receipts derived by a taxpayer from business transactions or activities which are incidental to its principal business activity and which are includible in apportionable income. However, substantial amounts of gross receipts arising from an incidental or occasional sale of a fixed asset used in connection with the taxpayer's regular trade or business will be excluded from the sales factor since such sales constitute a "casual sale" of property and the inclusion of such gross receipts will not fairly apportion to this state the income derived by the taxpayer from its business activity in this state. Gross receipts from casual sales are considered substantial if they cause the sales factor to be distorted. For example, gross receipts from the sale of a factory or plant will be excluded from the sales factor.
(b)  In including or excluding gross receipts, the taxpayer shall be consistent in the treatment of such gross receipts in filing returns with this state. In the event the taxpayer is not consistent in its reporting, it shall disclose in its return to this state the nature and extent of the inconsistency.

As applied to a taxpayer engaged in business activity other than the manufacturing and selling or purchasing and reselling of property, "sales" includes the gross receipts as defined in Rule .1001 of this Section (Sales Made In General Business Operations):
(1)	If the business activity consists of providing services; such as the operation of an advertising agency, or the performance of equipment service contracts or research and development contracts, "sales" includes the gross receipts from the performance of such services including fees, commissions, and similar items.
(2)	In the case of cost plus fixed fee contracts, such as the operation of a government‑owned plant for a fee, gross receipts includes the entire reimbursed cost, plus the fee.
(3)	If the business activity is the renting of real or tangible personal property, "sales" includes the gross receipts from the rental, lease, or licensing the use of the property.
(4)	If the business activity is the sale, assignment, or licensing of intangible personal property such as patents and copyrights, "sales" includes the gross receipts therefrom.

(b)  Property shall be deemed to be delivered or shipped to a purchaser within this state if the recipient is located in this state, even though the property is ordered from outside this state.
(c)  Property is delivered or shipped to a purchaser within this state if the shipment terminates in this state, even though the property is subsequently transferred by the purchaser to another state.
(d)  The term "purchaser within this state" shall include the ultimate recipient of the property if the taxpayer in this state, at the designation of the purchaser, delivers to or has the property shipped to the ultimate recipient within this state.
(e)  When property being shipped by a seller from the state of origin to consignee in another state is diverted while enroute to a purchaser in this state the sales are in this state.

For the purpose of this Rule, only sales for which the United States Government makes direct payment to the seller pursuant to the terms of its contract constitute sales to the United States Government. Thus, sales by a subcontractor to the prime contractor, the party to the contract with the United States Government, do not constitute sales to the United States Government.
(b)  When the United States Government is the purchaser of property which remains in the possession of the taxpayer in this state for further processing under another contract, or for other reasons, "shipment" is deemed to be made at the time of acceptance by the United States Government.

SECTION .1400 ‑ AMORTIZATION OF BOND PREMIUMS

17 NCAC 05C .1401	PRELIMINARY STATEMENT
If a corporation purchases a bond at more than its face value, the amount of premium paid may be amortized over the life of the bond. However, the allowance of a deduction against net income for amortization of the premium paid depends upon the type of bond purchased by the corporation. For example:
(1)	Amortization of premiums on tax‑exempt bonds by a corporation is mandatory with no deduction allowed in computing state net income.
(2)	A corporation may at its option amortize the amount of premiums paid on taxable bonds over the life of the bonds. If the premium is not amortized by the corporation, it will constitute part of the basis of the bond in determining gain or loss at maturity of sale.
(3)	For state income tax purposes, obligations of the United States or its possessions and obligations of the State of North Carolina or any of its subdivisions are tax‑exempt. Interest income received by a corporation on such obligations is not taxable; however, a corporation must include in its computation of state net income any gain or loss realized on the disposal of such obligations.
(4)	Premiums paid on all bonds acquired prior to January 1, 1963 cannot be amortized but constitute a part of the cost basis of the bonds in determining gain or loss when the bonds are sold.

17 NCAC 05C .1402	TAX‑EXEMPT BONDS
The amount of premium paid upon the purchase of a tax‑exempt bond is amortized over the life of the bond. Amortization for the taxable year is accomplished by reducing the original cost of the bond by a portion of the premium paid, with no deduction against net income for the year. Therefore, when the bond is sold or otherwise disposed of, the basis for determining gain or loss will always be original cost less the amount of premium amortized for book purposes through the year of disposal.

17 NCAC 05C .1403	TAXABLE BONDS
A portion of the premium paid upon the purchase of a taxable bond may be deducted in the taxable year only if an adjustment is made to the basis of the bond. If a taxpayer elects to amortize the premium, the basis for determining gain or loss will always be original cost less the amount of premium amortized and deducted in its tax returns through the year of disposal. Otherwise, the basis of a taxable bond for determining gain or loss will always be the entire amount paid for the bond.
